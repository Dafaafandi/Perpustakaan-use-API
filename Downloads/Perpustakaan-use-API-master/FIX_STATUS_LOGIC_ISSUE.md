# 🔧 Fix: Borrowed Books Status Logic Issue

## 📋 Problem Analysis

**Issue Identified from Console Logs:**

- API correctly returns `"status": "1"` (borrowed) for active borrowings
- Total: 196 borrowings, 27 for user 106
- Status breakdown: `{1: 62, 2: 59, 3: 75}` where 1=borrowed, 2=returned, 3=overdue
- **BUG:** UI shows all books as "Dikembalikan" (returned) despite API status being "1"

**Root Cause:**

1. **Incorrect Return Date Logic:** Code was falling back to `updated_at` field as return date
2. **Status Override Bug:** Logic was using presence of return date to override API status
3. **Wrong Priority:** Return date logic took precedence over API status field

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `_getActualReturnDate()` Method

**Before:**

```dart
// WRONG: Used updated_at as fallback return date
final actualReturnDate = ... || borrowing['updated_at'];
```

**After:**

```dart
// CORRECT: Only return actual return date for status "2" (returned)
if (status != "2" && status != 2) {
  return null; // No return date for non-returned books
}
```

**Key Changes:**

- ✅ Only looks for return date when status is "2" (returned)
- ✅ Removed `updated_at` fallback that was causing false positives
- ✅ Clear logic: no return date unless book is actually returned

### 2. Fixed `_getStatusText()` Method

**Before:**

```dart
// WRONG: Return date override API status
if (tanggalKembali != null) {
  return 'Dikembalikan';
}
```

**After:**

```dart
// CORRECT: API status is the source of truth
if (status == "2" || status == 2) {
  return 'Dikembalikan';
}
```

**Key Changes:**

- ✅ API status field is the primary source of truth
- ✅ Removed return date override that was causing incorrect status
- ✅ Added debug logging for first 3 records to track status logic

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging

**New Debug Features:**

```dart
=== STATUS DEBUG 245 ===
API Status: 1
Status type: String
Result: Dipinjam (API status 1, not overdue)
Due: 2025-07-26, Now: 2025-07-17T20:34:36.000000Z
==============================================
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Clear visibility into status decision logic
- ✅ Tracks API status value and type
- ✅ Shows due date comparison for overdue detection
- ✅ Limited to first 3 records to avoid console spam

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix:

- ❌ All books showing as "Dikembalikan" despite status "1"
- ❌ Return date logic overriding API status
- ❌ `updated_at` being used as false return date

### After Fix:

- ✅ Books with status "1" show as "Dipinjam"
- ✅ Books with status "2" show as "Dikembalikan"
- ✅ Books with status "3" show as "Terlambat"
- ✅ Overdue detection works for status "1" past due date
- ✅ API status field respected as source of truth

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Hot restart the app** (if using hot reload)
2. **Navigate to Borrowed Books section**
3. **Check console output** for new debug messages:
   ```
   === STATUS DEBUG [ID] ===
   API Status: 1
   Result: Dipinjam (API status 1, not overdue)
   ```
4. **Verify UI display:**
   - Books should now show correct status based on API
   - New borrowings should show as "Dipinjam"
   - Only truly returned books (status "2") show as "Dikembalikan"

## 🔍 Debug Console Examples

**For Borrowed Book (Status "1"):**

```
=== STATUS DEBUG 245 ===
API Status: 1
Status type: String
Result: Dipinjam (API status 1, not overdue)
===========================================
```

**For Returned Book (Status "2"):**

```
=== STATUS DEBUG XXX ===
API Status: 2
Status type: String
Result: Dikembalikan (API status 2)
===================================
```

## 📝 Technical Details

**Files Modified:**

- `lib/screens/member/borrowed_books_screen.dart`
  - `_getActualReturnDate()`: Fixed return date logic
  - `_getStatusText()`: Fixed status priority logic
  - `_getExpectedReturnDate()`: Reduced debug verbosity

**Logic Priority (Corrected):**

1. **API Status Field** (primary source of truth)
2. **Due Date Check** (for overdue detection on status "1")
3. **Return Date** (only for status "2" books)

**Status Mapping:**

- `"1"` or `1` → "Dipinjam" (check if overdue)
- `"2"` or `2` → "Dikembalikan"
- `"3"` or `3` → "Terlambat"

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Books with status "1" show as "Dipinjam"
- [ ] Books with status "2" show as "Dikembalikan"
- [ ] New borrowings immediately show as "Dipinjam"
- [ ] Console shows correct status debugging
- [ ] No false "Dikembalikan" status for active borrowings
- [ ] Overdue detection works for past due dates
